## About Travelpack

### Travelpack aims to take the stress out of planning group trips by creating a central source for messaging, planning an itinerary, and managing a budget. Think of us as GroupMe for trips!

> Travelpack is a native, cross platform application that helps users communicate more efficiently with one another as they plan their trip. Users search through activities, restaurants, etc as they create their day to day itinerary. Each itinerary activity allows users to upvote or downvote an activity to get an idea of what the pack is interested in doing on the trip. There is also a built in budget calculator that sources the price of hotels and flights to estimate the cost of the trip. 

During the trip users utilize travelpack's find my pack feature to pin point the real time locations of all of the members of the pack and upload photos to the pack photo album to keeps all of the photos from the trip in one place!
